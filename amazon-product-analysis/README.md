Amazon Product Performance Analysis: Pricing vs. Satisfaction
Overview
This project executes a full-cycle data analysis, from raw, messy data to an interactive business dashboard. The goal was to identify which product categories and pricing strategies (specifically discounting) drive the most revenue while balancing customer satisfaction (ratings).

The final deliverable is a Tableau dashboard providing actionable insights for inventory management and pricing strategy.

Key Business Findings (Actionable Insights)
The analysis was segmented into four key areas, yielding the following insights:

Revenue vs. Satisfaction (Q1): The Computers & Accessories category, while not the highest in total revenue, demonstrates the strongest balance of high customer satisfaction (highest average rating) and strong sales.

Pricing Tier Performance (Q2): The '1. Premium (â‚¹2000+)' price tier holds the highest average customer rating, suggesting that high-value products are meeting customer expectations, despite receiving the highest average discount (approximately 48%).

Top Performers (Q3): The highest-rated products serve as a benchmark for quality and pricing standards. [Note: Insert a specific example of a top-rated product here, e.g., "The top 10 products are dominated by long-life accessories like batteries and cables."]

Problem Stock (Q4): Identified low-rated inventory that is heavily discounted, highlighting products that require immediate review or removal. These products are disproportionately found in the Home & Kitchen category, suggesting a quality issue.
